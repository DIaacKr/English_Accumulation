# English_Accumulation  

### Brief
As the title shows, this is a summary repository about English accumulation.
I use it to record the focus and process of my English learning.
At the same time, this can also be said to be my first open repository. 
I hope I can make good use of github for various tasks and learning. Thank you all for reading .  
:D
